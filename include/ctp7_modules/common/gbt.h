   *  \brief Scan the GBT phases of one OptoHybrid.
   *
   *  \detail The scan seeks for valid RX phases for the VFAT's of one OptoHybrid.
   *          A phase is considered valid when `LINK_GOOD = 1`, `SYNC_ERR_CNT = 0` and `CFG_RUN != 0xdeaddead`.
   *          In order to improve the reliability of the scan, it is repeated `nScans` times.
   *
   *          The results are returned as a 2-dimensional array of GBT phases in ``std::vector<std::vector<uint32_t>>`` format,
   *          where the first index refers to the OptoHybrid index, and the second index corresponds to the VFAT index within the OptoHybrid.
   *          Each key is a word array of 16 elements for the 16 possible phases ordered from phase 0 to phase 15.
   *          Each word is the number of time the scan was "good" out of the total number of scan requested, nScans.
   *
   *          An error message of
   *          ```
   *          std::range_error: "The ohN parameter supplied (<ohN>) exceeds the number of OH's supported by the CTP7 (<ohMax>)."
   *          ```
   *          means that the CTP7 doesn't support that many OptoHybrids.
   *          Try again with a lower OptoHybrid number or on a different CTP7.
   *          ``ohMax`` is read from the register: ``"GEM_AMC.GEM_SYSTEM.CONFIG.NUM_OF_OH"``.
   *
   *  \throws \c std::range_error if the specified \c ohN is larger than that supported by the FW
   *
   *  \param[in] ohN OptoHybrid index number.
   *  \param[in] nResets The number of times the link reset and subsequent repeatedRegRead will be performed
   *  \param[in] phaseMin Lowest phase to scan (min = 0).
   *  \param[in] phaseMax Highest phase to scan (max = 15).
   *  \param[in] phaseStep Step to scan the phases.
   *  \param[in] nVerificationReads The number of reads for repeatedRegRead method
   *
   *  \return Returns a 2-dimensional array containing each phase of each VFAT in the OptoHybrid specified by ``ohN``.
